# print today's date one year from now
print("One year from now it will be: " + str(now + timedelta(days=365)))

# create a timedelta that uses more than one argument
print("In 2 days and 3 weeks, it will be " + str(now + timedelta(days=2, week3))


# calculate the date 1 week ago, formatted as a string


### How many days until April Fools' Day and Tax Day!


# use date comparison to see if April Fool's has already gone for this year
# if it has, use the replace() function to get the date for next year


# Now calculate the amount of time until April Fool's Day
